    <p>The best ever blueberry cookies get their vibrant 
        color and fruity flavor from frozen wild blueberries. 
        These cakey cookies, super cute and studded with 
        white chocolate chips, are also delicious.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen wild blueberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place frozen blueberries in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until blueberries are thawed, about 1 minute. Do not drain.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in blueberries and their juices, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla and beat on high speed until fairly smooth, about 5 minutes. Mixture will look curdled initially, but will emulsify and smooth out after several minutes of mixing on high speed.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, cornstarch and baking powder on low speed until combined. Stir in white chocolate chips. </li>
        <li>Cover cookie dough and refrigerate until chilled, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.</li>
        <li>Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized balls of dough; place 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Use damp hands to flatten the cookies slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies just begin to turn brown on the edges, 10 to 14 minutes. Cool cookies on the pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
